                There are so many reasons to love cycling. You can do it indoors or outdoors, at home or at the gym. It's also low-impact, making it easier on achy joints, and of course, it burns calories! But if you're someone who uses cycling as your go-to workout — or you're considering adding it to your workout regimen — you may be wondering if cycling can really lead to better overall health, especially if you have little time to spare. POPSUGAR spoke with experts to find out if cycling for even 30 minutes a day is enough to lose weight and put you on the path to feeling stronger and healthier.

                Can You Lose Weight by Cycling For 30 Minutes a Day?
                "It is possible to lose weight from cycling 30 minutes a day," Jennifer Chew, MPT, MSc, an NASM-certified personal trainer and weight loss specialist, told POPSUGAR. Thirty minutes of cycling burns 200 calories on average, although that number depends on a few factors, including your weight, the intensity of your workout, and the resistance, Chew explained.
                
                If you're looking to burn the maximum number of calories you can in those 30 minutes, there are a couple of ways to make that happen:
                
                Up your resistance. "The easiest way is definitely to increase resistance," Chew said. "Cardio is like resistance training. You need to use progressive overload principles to get better and to avoid plateaus." June Sayer, an ACE-certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor agreed, adding that there are benefits to even slowing down your pace but upping your resistance during your 30-minute workout.
                Add in short, high-intensity intervals. "As your body gets stronger, you are able to increase the intensity, with a mixture of short spin intervals," Sayer explained. Try adding short bursts of sprints to your workout, or even intervals of low-cadence, high-resistance cycling.
                While weight loss is possible while cycling 30 minutes a day, Sayer and Chew stressed the importance of incorporating strength training and making other lifestyle changes in order to ensure you make progress on your goals.
                
                "When you're pairing a strength training regimen with cardiovascular activity, [like cycling], your body composition will change significantly by increasing calorie burn and muscle mass," Krystal Goodman, an NCSF-certified personal trainer and coach at Orangetheory, told POPSUGAR. Goodman explained that the combination of elevating your heart rate through cycling and adding in that strength-training component will "give you the real bang for your buck" when it comes to fat burn and weight loss. Chew agreed, noting that increased muscle mass "promotes better metabolism," which ultimately allows your body to lose weight more sustainably.
                
                A combination of cardio and strength training, paired with a healthy diet, should help you get results. But the diet is key: "At the end of the day, the most important point to losing weight is daily caloric intake versus daily caloric expenditure," Chew said. "If you are constantly eating less calories than you are burning, you will lose weight."
                
                Trainer Tips For Sustaining Your Cycling Routine
                So, now that you've committed to cycling 30 minutes a day, you may be wondering how you can sustain that moving forward! Here are some effective, easy-to-apply suggestions from the experts.
                
                Add healthier foods to your diet. By eating healthier and incorporating nutrient-dense foods into your meals, you'll have more energy to put towards your workouts, Goodman explained. Why does this matter? When you're better fueled, you'll be able to sustain working out daily, and cycle at a higher intensity with more resistance.
                Mix up indoor and outdoor cycling. Although Sayer doesn't feel there's a significant difference between cycling indoors or biking outside, rotating between indoor and outdoor workouts at least seasonally is an easy way to add variety to your routine.
                Find a cycling buddy. Sayer suggests cycling with a friend, to keep one another accountable and to "support each other, which will make it more fun." And if your friend isn't close in proximity, no worries — you can also hop on a call as you cycle together, keeping each other virtual company during each session!

            Everything in your body is connected, which means the pain you feel in one area might be caused by a weakness or an underlying injury in another. Take your hips, for example. You probably know how sore and tight this area can get just from sitting or working out, but if your hip muscles are weak, you could be in for bigger issues.

Why Should You Strengthen Your Hips?
"Weak hip muscles can cause you to have back pain, knee pain, or ankle injuries," said physical therapist Lauren Lobert Frison, DPT, OMPT, CSCS, owner of APEX Physical Therapy in Brighton, MI. Back pain can occur when your back "takes over" some of the action of your hips, Frison explained, such as when you're walking or squatting, causing your back to over-arch and potentially lead to disc injuries, back spasms, or pain. Your hip muscles also help to stabilize your pelvis; if they're lacking in strength, your hips will drop slightly, causing your spine to bow to the side and causing irritation and pain.

Dealing with knee pain? Your hips might have something to do with that, too. "If your hips are weak, your knees tend to cave in as you do things like squats or jumping," Frison told POPSUGAR. Over time, this can lead to knee or ankle pain and put you at greater risk of major knee injuries, she added, such as an ACL tear.
